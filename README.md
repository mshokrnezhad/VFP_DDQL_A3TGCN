# VFP_DDQL_A3TGCN
A Virtual Function Placement (VFP) method using Double Deep Q-Learning (DDQL) powered by A3TGCN (a Graph Neural Network -GNN- layer).

A3TGCN paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07659)

This repository implements the VNF placement agent described here (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10207694/) using GNN.

This method employs ReNet as its learning environment. For more details, check here: https://github.com/mshokrnezhad/ReNet
